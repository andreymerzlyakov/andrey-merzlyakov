### Task 1.

Given an integer n, return a counter function. This counter function initially returns n and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc).

``` javascript
Example 1:

Input:
n = 10
["call","call","call"]
Output: [10,11,12]
Explanation:
counter() = 10 // The first time counter() is called, it returns n.
counter() = 11 // Returns 1 more than the previous time.
counter() = 12 // Returns 1 more than the previous time.

Example 2:

Input:
n = -2
["call","call","call","call","call"]
Output: [-2,-1,0,1,2]
Explanation: counter() initially returns -2. 
Then increases after each sebsequent call.
```


### Task 2.
Given an integer array nums, a reducer function fn, and an initial value init, return the final result obtained by executing the fn function on each element of the array, sequentially, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element.

This result is achieved through the following operations: val = fn(init, nums[0]), val = fn(val, nums[1]), val = fn(val, nums[2]), ... until every element in the array has been processed. The ultimate value of val is then returned.

If the length of the array is 0, the function should return init.

Please solve it without using the built-in Array.reduce method.
``` javascript
Example 1:

Input: 
nums = [1,2,3,4]
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return accum + curr; }
init = 0
Output: 10
Explanation:
initially, the value is init=0.
(0) + nums[0] = 1
(1) + nums[1] = 3
(3) + nums[2] = 6
(6) + nums[3] = 10
The final answer is 10.
Example 2:

Input: 
nums = [1,2,3,4]
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return accum + curr * curr; }
init = 100
Output: 130
Explanation:
initially, the value is init=100.
(100) + nums[0] * nums[0] = 101
(101) + nums[1] * nums[1] = 105
(105) + nums[2] * nums[2] = 114
(114) + nums[3] * nums[3] = 130
The final answer is 130.
Example 3:

Input: 
nums = []
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return 0; }
init = 25
Output: 25
Explanation: For empty arrays, the answer is always init.
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
0 <= init <= 1000
```

### Task 3.
Given a function fn, return a memoized version of that function.

A memoized function is a function that will never be called twice with the same inputs. Instead it will return a cached value.

You can assume there are 3 possible input functions: sum, fib, and factorial.

sum accepts two integers a and b and returns a + b. Assume that if a value has already been cached for the arguments (b, a) where a != b, it cannot be used for the arguments (a, b). For example, if the arguments are (3, 2) and (2, 3), two separate calls should be made.
fib accepts a single integer n and returns 1 if n <= 1 or fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) otherwise.
factorial accepts a single integer n and returns 1 if n <= 1 or factorial(n - 1) * n otherwise.
``` javascript
Example 1:

Input:
fnName = "sum"
actions = ["call","call","getCallCount","call","getCallCount"]
values = [[2,2],[2,2],[],[1,2],[]]
Output: [4,4,1,3,2]
Explanation:
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
const memoizedSum = memoize(sum);
memoizedSum(2, 2); // "call" - returns 4. sum() was called as (2, 2) was not seen before.
memoizedSum(2, 2); // "call" - returns 4. However sum() was not called because the same inputs were seen before.
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 1
memoizedSum(1, 2); // "call" - returns 3. sum() was called as (1, 2) was not seen before.
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 2
Example 2:

Input:
fnName = "factorial"
actions = ["call","call","call","getCallCount","call","getCallCount"]
values = [[2],[3],[2],[],[3],[]]
Output: [2,6,2,2,6,2]
Explanation:
const factorial = (n) => (n <= 1) ? 1 : (n * factorial(n - 1));
const memoFactorial = memoize(factorial);
memoFactorial(2); // "call" - returns 2.
memoFactorial(3); // "call" - returns 6.
memoFactorial(2); // "call" - returns 2. However factorial was not called because 2 was seen before.
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 2
memoFactorial(3); // "call" - returns 6. However factorial was not called because 3 was seen before.
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 2
Example 3:

Input:
fnName = "fib"
actions = ["call","getCallCount"]
values = [[5],[]]
Output: [8,1]
Explanation:
fib(5) = 8 // "call"
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 1
 

Constraints:

0 <= a, b <= 105
1 <= n <= 10
1 <= actions.length <= 105
actions.length === values.length
actions[i] is one of "call" and "getCallCount"
fnName is one of "sum", "factorial" and "fib"
```

### Task 4.
Given two promises promise1 and promise2, return a new promise. promise1 and promise2 will both resolve with a number. The returned promise should resolve with the sum of the two numbers.
``` javascript
Example 1:

Input: 
promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 20)), 
promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(5), 60))
Output: 7
Explanation: The two input promises resolve with the values of 2 and 5 respectively. The returned promise should resolve with a value of 2 + 5 = 7. The time the returned promise resolves is not judged for this problem.
Example 2:

Input: 
promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(10), 50)), 
promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(-12), 30))
Output: -2
Explanation: The two input promises resolve with the values of 10 and -12 respectively. The returned promise should resolve with a value of 10 + -12 = -2.
 

Constraints:

promise1 and promise2 are promises that resolve with a number
```


### Task 5.
Given an array arr and a chunk size size, return a chunked array.

A chunked array contains the original elements in arr, but consists of subarrays each of length size. The length of the last subarray may be less than size if arr.length is not evenly divisible by size.

Please solve it without using lodash's _.chunk function.


``` javascript
Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], size = 1
Output: [[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]]
Explanation: The arr has been split into subarrays each with 1 element.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,9,6,3,2], size = 3
Output: [[1,9,6],[3,2]]
Explanation: The arr has been split into subarrays with 3 elements. However, only two elements are left for the 2nd subarray.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [8,5,3,2,6], size = 6
Output: [[8,5,3,2,6]]
Explanation: Size is greater than arr.length thus all elements are in the first subarray.
Example 4:

Input: arr = [], size = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are no elements to be chunked so an empty array is returned.
 

Constraints:

2 <= arr.length <= 105
1 <= size <= arr.length + 1
